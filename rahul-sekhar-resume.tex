\section{Work Experience}

\vspace{6pt}

\cventry
{\textcolor{light}{2015--current}}
{Member of Technical Staff}
{}
{Nutanix}{Bangalore}
{I lead a team of front end developers at Nutanix, working on the interface for a number of technical tools, including sizing and quote generation for clusters, automated deployment and migration of workloads and healthcheck tools for clusters and migrated workloads. The company sets a great deal of importance on design and UX, and we ensure our interfaces are intuitive, clean, well designed and robust. My work here involves:
\vspace{6pt}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Front end architectural decisions based on the requirements of each tool.
  \item Using modern tools and workflows to ensure code is well written and tested yet flexible and quick to write.
  \item Agile, scrum based methodology with two-week sprints for each project.
  \item Monitoring code quality across simultaneous projects.
  \item Interfacing with designers, stakeholders and technical experts to produce an intuitive, useful and well designed product.
  \item Working closely with the design team at the company headquarters in San Jose, USA. I travelled to San Jose to explore and kick-off a collaborative project with the team there.
  \item Refactoring and improving the workflow for legacy projects.
  \item I introduced TDD as a development approach and converted an untested codebase to one with 100\% test coverage.
\end{itemize}}

{Web Architect}
{}
{Kairi Studios}{Bangalore}
{At Kairi Studios I worked on webapps and sites for our clients from end to end -- technical design, development and deployment. While I worked with the full stack here, due to the nature of our projects my focus was on front-end development. We received a great deal of appreciation for our interfaces, and the maintainability and robustness of our output.
\endgraf
\vspace{6pt}
Some of our projects included a redesign and extensive administration interface for NCF India, an internal academics and journaling system for small schools, and and an online store for childrens books. My work at Kairi involved:
\vspace{6pt}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Architecture and tooling decisions based on client requirements.
  \item Behaviour driven development, with user focused stories and thorough automated testing.
  \item Projects that used AngularJS, Backbone, Ruby on Rails and Wordpress.
  \item Responsive, mobile-friendly layouts.
  \item Modern, creative and best practice based development.
  \item Documentation and maintenance of projects.
\end{itemize}}

{Freelance}{}
{I put together websites in collaboration with some very talented designers as a freelance developer. My focus was to find creative solutions to problems and write clean, maintainable code that followed best practices. I made it a point to explore new technologies, frameworks, tools and techniques in an effort to stay up-to-date and remain flexible in my infrastructure choices, which has served me well.}
